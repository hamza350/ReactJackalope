react boiler plate

npm install webpack --save-dev




Code splitting - isolated code chunks / snippets loaded on demand.
Babel Loader - translates ES6 to ES5 (full browser compatibility)

include javascript files within each other

webpack-dev-server - loads generated code up into browser, localhost 8080 by default. Similar to python -m SimpleHTTPServer

webpack bundles the entry point and all of its dependecies into a single .bundle.js file

Watch Mode (don't have to re-run webpack, picks up changes automatically)
webpack app.js bundle.js --watch



USE WEBPACK CLI and EJECT IT
eject - something a lot more advance or custom with webpack than what the cli provides for commands like ng build and ng serve.
webpack.config.js
so that you can then customize it further

Run Tests

#What versions of webpack are available
npm view webpack versions
npm install webpack@2.1.0-beta.25 --save

http-server -p 3000

npm run build

strict versions

npm install --save-dev webpack-bundle-analyzer

Tree shaking - remove dead code
Unused code is removed by a minifier (such as UglifyJS). Tree-shaking just makes it possible for minifier to remove it.

npm i --save-dev uglifyjs-webpack-plugin

Tag sources to re-build specific versions. Something like Archiva for webpack. Put them in npm.
Best Practices. Enterprise NPM locally.  Repo or CDNs.

webpack -p --config ./webpack.production.config.js


"scripts": {
    "build": "NODE_ENV=production webpack -p --config ./webpack.production.config.js"
},

git detached head - does not belong or point to any branch.

git tag and also upload a build some where.
